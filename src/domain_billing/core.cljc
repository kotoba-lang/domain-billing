  "Billing for domain registrations: a price book, and a fold from `srs` events
  to ledger entries.

  `srs` returns events rather than performing effects, and this is the first
  consumer of that decision. The dependency points one way — this library reads
  `srs` events; `srs` knows nothing about money.

  ## Refund eligibility is not recomputed here

  The one thing a billing layer is most tempted to do, and the one thing it
  must not. Whether a delete is refundable depends on the RFC 3915 grace
  periods, and those are lifecycle policy: `srs.lifecycle/refundable?` already
  answers it, and the answer travels on the event as `:event/refundable?` and
  `:event/within-grace`. A billing layer that recomputed it from dates would be
  a second implementation of the same rule, free to drift — and the direction it
  drifts decides whether registrants get money back.

  So `charge-for` reads the event and never looks at a date.

  ## Money is integer minor units

  Every amount here is an integer count of the currency's minor unit — cents for
  USD, **whole yen for JPY**, which has none. Floating point cannot represent
  `0.1`, so a price book in dollars accumulates error the moment it is summed,
  and the error shows up as an invoice that is off by a cent for reasons nobody
  can reconstruct. `:currency` travels with every amount because a number
  without one is not a price, and mixing two silently is how a ¥1,000 charge
  becomes a $1,000 charge.

  ## What this library does not do

  No payment. No card, no wallet, no gateway, no stored credential. It produces
  ledger entries and a balance; taking money is a deployment's job, and it is a
  regulated one. Keeping the boundary here means this library holds nothing that
  needs a vault."
